.nh
.SH NAME
deb\-conffiles \- package conffiles
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
conffiles
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A package declares its list of conffiles by including a \fIconffiles\fP file
in its control archive (i.e. \fIDEBIAN/conffiles\fP during package creation).
.PP
This file contains a list of files, one per line.
They should be listed as absolute pathnames, and should exist in the binary
package, otherwise \fBdpkg\fP(1) will ignore them (although by default
\fBdpkg\-deb\fP(1) will refuse to build such binary packages).
Trailing whitespace will be trimmed, and empty lines will be ignored.
